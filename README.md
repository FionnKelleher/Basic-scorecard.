# Basic-scorecard.
A basic scorecard for a course near to me, White Manor. You can easily customise this to any course around you as well. Frankly the way that I run it is just putting it into a 3-in-1 intepereter like codepen.io because it intuits the start syntaxes for each language, which I didn't put there.
